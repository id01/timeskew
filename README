(Early version)
1. "make" will provide libtimeskew.so
2. Use `TIMESKEW="2 1" LD_PRELOAD=./libtimeskew.so program` to start program with time 2x faster than usual
3. Create/update "timeskew" file in current directory to update time coefficient, e.g. `echo 1 3 > timeskew` - slow down 3x.

TIMESHIFT also sets constant time shift

id01: Made a few adjustments. Got rid of the long long int warning and made a c++ script to execute timeshift easier. Also added float/decimal input support. Cheers!
New Usage: timeskew [mode] [args] [command]
